packer.
should create a Managedimage that will be used to deploy a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine. A user named "website" should be created inside the Image. An IIS web server should be installed in the Image and the default website should server the content: "Wohooo, an IIS server. My favorite!". 
(The default path from which IIS serves websites is Clinetpub\webroot))

o	client_id, client_secret, tenant_id, subscription_id: These fields are required to authenticate with your Azure account. Replace them with your actual Azure credentials.
o	managed_image_resource_group_name: The name of the resource group where the managed image will be stored.
o	managed_image_name: The name of the managed image to be created.
o	managed_image_location: The Azure region where the managed image will be created.
o	os_type: Specifies the operating system type, which is "Windows" in this case.
o	image_publisher, image_offer, image_sku: These fields specify the base image to use, which is Windows Server 2016 Datacenter edition in this case.
o	communicator: Specifies the communicator to use. For Windows, winrm is used.
o	winrm_use_ssl, winrm_insecure, winrm_timeout, winrm_username: These fields configure the WinRM connection settings.
o	azure_tags: Tags to apply to the Azure resources created.
o	build_resource_group_name: The name of the resource group to use for building the image.
o	vm_size: Specifies the size of the temporary VM used to build the image.
â€¢	provisioners: This section contains the configuration for the provisioners.
o	type: Specifies the provisioner type, which is powershell in this case.
o	inline: A list of PowerShell commands to run during the provisioning step. The first provisioner creates a user named "website" and adds this user to the "Administrators" group. The second provisioner installs the IIS web server and configures the default website to serve the specified content.
Steps to Use the Configuration
1.	Save the Packer configuration to a file named windows-server-2016-iis.json.
2.	Replace YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID, and YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID with your actual Azure credentials.
3.	Ensure you have Packer installed on your local machine.
4.	Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to initiate the build process:
